                <h1>Towards a zero electricity bill</h1>
                <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old
                    bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat
                    pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next
                    step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install
                    a
                    system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed
                    to wipe that power bill for now and into the future</p>

                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The
                    earth is warmer than
                    the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can
                    engineer a solution
                    to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home
                    warming energy year-round.</p>
                <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and
                    environmentally friendly, but
                    has previously been geographically limited to areas near
                    tectonic plate
                    boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically
                    expanded the
                    range and size of viable resources, especially for direct
                    applications such as
                    home heating.</p>
                <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped
                    deep within the
                    earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of
                    conventional fossil fuels.
                    As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help
                    mitigate global warming
                    if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

                    blows. Team a
                    wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your
